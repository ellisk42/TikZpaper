    Abstract = {The goal of software synthesis is to generate programs automatically from high-level specifications. However, efficient implementations for challenging programs require a combination of high-level algorithmic insights and low-level implementation details. Deriving the low-level details is a natural job for a computer, but the synthesizer can not replace the human insight. Therefore, one of the central challenges for software synthesis is to establish a synergy between the programmer and the synthesizer, exploiting the programmer's expertise to reduce the burden on the synthesizer.

	Abstract = {Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.},

	abstract = {Given a CNF formula and a weight for each assignment of values tovariables, two natural problems are weighted model counting anddistribution-aware sampling of satisfying assignments.  Both problems have a wide variety of important applications.  Due to the inherentcomplexity of the exact versions of the problems, interest has focusedon solving them approximately.  Prior work in this area scaled only tosmall problems in practice, or failed to provide strong theoreticalguarantees, or employed a computationally-expensive most-probable-explanation ({\MPE}) queries that assumes prior knowledge of afactored representation of the weight distribution. We identify a novel parameter,\emph{tilt}, which is the ratio of the maximum weight of satisfying assignment to minimum weightof satisfying assignment and present anovel approach that works with a black-box oracle for weights ofassignments and requires only an {\NP}-oracle (in practice, a {\SAT}-solver) to solve both thecounting and sampling problems when the tilt is small.  Our approach  provides strong theoretical guarantees, and scales toproblems involving several thousand variables. We also show that theassumption of small tilt can be significantly relaxed while improving computational efficiency if a factored representation of the weights is known.},

	booktitle = {NIPS Workshop | Bounded Optimality and Rational Metareasoning},
	year = {2015},
	month = {12/2015},
	abstract = {<p>Many AI problems, such as planning, grammar learning, program induction, and theory discovery, require searching in symbolic domains. Most models perform this search by evaluating a sequence of candidate solutions, generated in order by some heuristic. Human reasoning, though, is not limited to sequential trial and error.\&nbsp; In particular, humans are able to reason <em>about </em>what the solution to a particular problem should look like, before comparing candidates against the data. In a program synthesis task, for instance, a human might first determine that the task at hand should be solved by a tail-recursive algorithm, before filling in the\&nbsp; algorithm{\textquoteright}s details.</p>

<p>Reasoning in this way about solution structure confers at least two computational advantages. First, a given structure subsumes a potentially large collection of primitive solutions, and exploiting the constraints present in the structure{\textquoteright}s definition makes it possible to eval- uate the collection in substantially less time than it would take to evaluate each in turn. For example, a programmer might quickly conclude that a given algorithm cannot be implemented without recursion, without having to consider all possible non-recursive solutions. Second, it is often possible to estimate ahead of time the cost of evaluating different structures, making it possible to prioritize those that can be treated cheaply. In planning a route through an unfamiliar city, for example, one might first consider possibilities which use the subway exclusively, excluding for the moment ones that involve bus trips as well: if a successfully subway-only solution can be found, one then avoids the (potentially) exponentially more difficult bus-and-subway search problem.</p>

<p>Here, we consider a family of toy problems [1], in which an agent is given a balance scale, and is required to find a lighter counterfeit coin in a collection of genuine coins using at most some prescribed number of weighings. We develop a language for expressing solution structure\&nbsp; that places restrictions on a set of <em>programs</em>,\&nbsp; and use recent program synthesis techniques to search for a solution, encoded as a program, subject to hypothesized constraints on the program \&nbsp;structure.</p>

  abstract = {We develop a first line of attack for solving programming
              competition-style problems from input-output examples using
              deep learning. The approach is to train a neural network to
              predict properties of the  program that generated the outputs
              from the inputs. We use the neural network's predictions to
              augment search techniques from the programming languages
              community, including enumerative search and an SMT-based
              solver. Empirically, we show that our approach leads to an
              order of magnitude speedup over the strong non-augmented
              baselines and a Recurrent Neural Network approach, and
              that we are able to solve problems of difficulty comparable
              to the simplest problems on programming competition websites.},
